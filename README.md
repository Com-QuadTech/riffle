#Riffle

This is a performance accurate (but probably not security
accurate) implementation of the anonymous communication system,
Riffle, that appear in PETS 2016.

NOTE: This prototype implements most of what's described in the paper,
but does NOT make any guarantees about security. This prototype is
almost certainly full of security bugs. Please do not adapt this code
to use for real anonymous communication.
